I'm going to use youtube tutorials and online articles/blog posts to help me learn jQuery. I find that the videos in the releases are very helpful to me since I can see the thing being live-coded. Instead of just reading about it, I think that seeing it being done and following along is the most helpful way to learn since it is very hands-on and you are actually doing the thing. I should stop and test what I've learned every time I learn a new thing that I haven't worked with before. Breaks are important, but for me I like to sit down and just get it done while the information is still fresh in my brain. However, taking 1 break to let the information sink in is definitely good. 

Review: I ended up using mostly written articles and snippets of code that I tried for myself. The videos weren't as helpful as I thought they would be. Experimenting on my own using code from tutorials was the most helpful learning method.
