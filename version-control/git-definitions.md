# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
** Version control is a way of organizing a file system with a lot of different old and new versions of files. It's useful because it keeps everything organized and also allows you to access older versions of a file if needed.** 
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
** A branch is a fork inside a repository in which changes to files can be made. It is useful because you can make changes in a certain branch that isn't the master branch and it will not affect the main code unless you merge the branch into the master branch.**
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
** A commit is a change to the repository that is saved and logged. A good commit message says which file was changed and a summary of the changes that have been made to it.**
* What is a merge conflict?
** A merge conflict is when you attempt to merge a branch to another branch but git does not know which version is correct. It can occur if for instance someone changes file A on one branch while another person is changing file A on a different branch. When the two branches are attempted to be merged together a merge conflict would occur.
