<!-- 
1. The purpose of HTML semantic tags is to help specify and give more information about 
	the tags being used and the page. I think the main tag is the most useful since it
	specifies which content is unique to that page only. 

2. The HTML in a page is loaded first by the browser from top to bottom. That means that
	the head will load first then the header and rest of body and lastly the footer.

3. Sublime is helpful to code in HTML with because it has a lot of useful tools. 

4. In this challenge, the most difficult concept was understanding the differences and
	importance of each different semantic tag, such as aside versus section. To improve
	my understanding of this concept I can read up on the tags more, but more importantly
	I will need to practice using them in code so I can get more familiar with them.
